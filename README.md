# Cash Machine: Algorithmic Trading Bot

Cash Machine is a highly sophisticated and personalized algorithmic trading bot designed for executing buy and sell orders on trading platforms in both stock and crypto markets. It provides a user-friendly interface, enabling retail investors to participate in algo trading traditionally reserved for larger investment firms. The bot utilizes computer programming and financial market insights to execute trades with precision, eliminate emotional biases, and ensure efficient execution with lower trading fees.

# Machine Learning Indicator: Logistic Regression

The trading algorithm powering Cash Machine relies on a machine learning indicator known as "Logistic Regression," specifically tailored for volatile crypto and stock markets. Unlike Linear Regression, Logistic Regression fits an S-shaped curve (Sigmoid) to observations, effectively separating data points. The model's objective is to find weights using gradient descent, accomplished through the logistic regression function by updating weights in multiple iterations. Ultimately, the weights pass through the sigmoid function, producing a prediction.

# Execution of Trades:

Cash Machine seamlessly executes trade orders on multiple trading platforms, including Alpaca, Uniswap, and Binance. This multi-platform integration allows for diversified trading across stocks and crypto assets. The use of Alpaca facilitates trading in traditional stocks, Uniswap for decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions, and Binance for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Trades of each platforms are executed using their official APIs and complete docker image is hosted on Azure Cloud Service. 

# Evolution and Future Expansion

Cash Machine is in a constant state of evolution and is poised to extend its trading capabilities to Futures and Options by leveraging additional back-tested strategies akin to High-Frequency Trading. The long-term vision is to transform into a fully automated hedge fund, proficient in trading live markets without active broker involvement, employing sophisticated coding and trading algorithms. Cash Machine can execute multiple buy and sell orders for diverse stocks and crypto coins, facilitating multiple clients in generating profits. The ultimate vision is to make passive income accessible to anyone, eliminating the need for active monitoring of financial markets and establishing itself as a convenient and reliable investment tool.
